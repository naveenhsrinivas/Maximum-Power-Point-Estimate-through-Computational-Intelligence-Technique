# Maximum-Power-Point-Estimate-through-Computational-Intelligence-Technique
The Maximum Power Point (MPP) is the working state of a solar panel which maximizes its energy production 
and can depend on several factors. In the present paper prediction of the MPP value of a panel is modeled 
using mainly on the temperature of the panel, the voltage, 
the current and used Feed-forward Neural Networks for this task. 
Finally, the result of the model has been studied and discussed the prediction error.
